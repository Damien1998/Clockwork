December is the perfect season for shopkeepers - the festive period motivates people to shop. This year, however, a new individual joins the otherwise familiar faces. His premises are filled with all sorts of machinery and trucks encourage potential customers with the mysterious words: “NORTHERN SNOW FOR EVERY OCCASION“

Welcome, welcome! Sir, ma’am, perhaps you could be convinced to buy some snow?

Snow?

But of course! Fine snow, powdery snow, clustered snow - I’ve got snow for every occasion!

It’s already snowing. Why would we need more snow?

See, sir, business is booming!

What?

Here, my pricing.

If you were to purchase snow for an entire week, you’d get a special sale for the next few days. For valued customers.

That’s pricey.

Unfortunately, snow imported straight from the North Pole has its price…

But you, sir, are an expert, you can surely tell good quality products. No other snow crunches under one’s shoes as mine does!

Well, then, are you buying?

You leave the shopkeeper behind and breathe a sigh of relief. He failed to convince you to buy his snow. What’s on the ground right now is definitely enough. The fox cleans up his stall, puffing angrily.

The fox gladly accepts your bill, sneakily hiding it in his pocket, as if afraid you’d change your mind. He disappears inside the premises, leaving the two of you with a giant snow machine.
