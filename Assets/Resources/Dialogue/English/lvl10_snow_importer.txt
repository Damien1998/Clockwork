December is the perfect season for shopkeepers - the festive period motivates people to shop. This year, however, a new individual joins the otherwise familiar faces. His premises are filled with all sorts of machinery and trucks encourage potential customers with the mysterious words: “NORTHERN SNOW FOR EVERY OCCASION“

You leave the shopkeeper behind and breathe a sigh of relief. He failed to convince you to buy his snow. What’s on the ground right now is definitely enough. The fox cleans up his stall, puffing angrily.

The fox gladly accepts your bill, sneakily hiding it in his pocket, as if afraid you’d change your mind. He disappears inside the premises, leaving the two of you with a giant snow machine.
