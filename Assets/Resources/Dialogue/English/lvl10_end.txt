It’s a shame mom and dad couldn’t make it.

They told me on the phone that something held them up. At least they’re healthy and doing well.

Ania, there you are! Come over here, we have yet to give each other wishes. 
--Anna

Już idę!

Edward, I don’t think we’ve had the pleasure…
--Edward

Oh, Mr. Jasper. Yes, I believe we haven’t.
--Pan Jasper

Please, call me by my name. This is not a business meeting for us to refer to each other so officially.
--Edward

Of course… Jasper…

Well, what can I wish you? Surely, a lot of strength, health and patience.
I’m sure you could use them with all the work you have.
And happiness. Just like that.
--Jasper
--portrait Jasper_Snow_Smiling Jasper
Thank you. Even if those things don’t help, they surely will do no harm, either.
And I wish you a lot of success.

Although now that I think about it, you two are doing quite well in that field.
--portrait Jasper_Snow_Smiling Jasper
Well, then, I wish you to use your time as best as you can.
--portrait Jasper_Snow Jasper
Seriously, you cannot imagine how many people waste it just like that. I hope you two will take the opposite course.
--Edward

I’ll make sure of it.

Ania, the postman has dropped off some packages. What could it be?
--Anna
--portrait Anna_Snow_Surprised Anna
Edward, there’s a letter attached, too. Read it and I’ll try to open the package.
--Jasper
--portrait Jasper_Snow_Scared Jasper
Oh dear, that looks suspiciously similar to the tax office packages…
--Anna

Hey, we got a watch! Red and white, with a golden case… There’s even a mistletoe branch.
--portrait Anna_Happy Anna
I think I know who sent this.
--Vladyslav IX

It’s always clocks, nothing but clocks. They’re haunting me, those ticking vampires.

Izabela thanks us for our gift… So it came on time. Aside from that, she wishes us good tidings.

…
And asks us to come to the North Pole. Apparently it will be a mess after Christmas and they’ll need any help they can get.
--Anna
--portrait Anna_Surprised Anna
We- We’re going to the North Pole?
--portrait Anna_Happy Anna
Edward, we’re going to the North Pole!
--Vladyslav IX
--portrait Vlad_Snow Vlad
Well, what are you standing here for? We need to celebrate! Bring out the drinks!
--Anna
--portrait Anna_Happy Anna
Oh, dear, I prefer to avoid such things… Ah, whatever. Pour me one.
--Edward
--portrait Edward_Mildly_Stressed Edward
I’ve got a bad feeling about this…
