It’s a shame mom and dad couldn’t make it.

They told me on the phone that something held them up. At least they’re healthy and doing well.

Edward, I don’t think we’ve had the pleasure…

Oh, Mr. Jasper. Yes, I believe we haven’t.

Please, call me by my name. This is not a business meeting for us to refer to each other so officially.

Of course… Jasper…

--talk 1 Edward
Well, what can I wish you? Surely, a lot of strength, health and patience.
--talk 1 Edward
I’m sure you could use them with all the work you have.

And happiness. Just like that.

--talk 3 Jasper
Thank you. Even if those things don’t help, they surely will do no harm, either.
--talk 3 Jasper
And I wish you a lot of success.

--talk 3 Jasper
Well, then, I wish you to use your time as best as you can.

Ania, the postman has dropped off some packages. What could it be?

--animate 0 EnterUp
Edward, there’s a letter attached, too. Read it and I’ll try to open the package.

Oh dear, that looks suspiciously similar to the tax office packages…

Hey, we got a watch! Red and white, with a golden case… There’s even a mistletoe branch.

It’s always clocks, nothing but clocks. They’re haunting me, those ticking vampires.

Izabela thanks us for our gift… So it came on time. Aside from that, she wishes us good tidings.

And asks us to come to the North Pole. Apparently it will be a mess after Christmas and they’ll need any help they can get.
