Contrary to expectations, the Christmas fever does not affect everyone. A perfect example of that is a young man, slowly strolling in his own pace, paying no mind to the crowds. He is most certainly not dressed warm enough for the weather. He seems lost… But in his own way, free.

Isn’t it too cold for this outfit?

No, no… I mean, yes, but it means nothing.

So many people running around and you’re just strolling down the alley without any hurry… How?

Ah, but it’s so simple… Existing among others, we are subject to norms and customs, even if they’re harmful for us…

Meanwhile, I do not stand for this absurdity and simply live by my own rules.

Um… Are you trying to say the chaotic pursuit of all those people is absurd?

--talk 3 Philosopher
Oh, not just that. Take life itself, for example. It doesn’t have an objective goal to it.

We are being pushed into this world without any guiding signs or methods to exist that are proven to work.

Isn’t that simply foolish?

I… Suppose so?

Thankfully, one can deal with that.

I wonder what hour is it… Damn it, something’s wrong with my watch again!

Wait, aren’t you two those famous watchmakers?

Indeed, that’s us. I suppose you know where our workshop is?
--portrait 3 Philosopher_Smiling Philosopher
--talk 3 Philosopher
Yes, I do. What a hilarious absurdity, to meet you right at this moment! Well, then, I’ll be very grateful for your help. Of course, I’ll come over myself to pick up my watch.
