Contrary to expectations, the Christmas fever does not affect everyone. A perfect example of that is a young man, slowly strolling in his own pace, paying no mind to the crowds. He is most certainly not dressed warm enough for the weather. He seems lost… But in his own way, free.

Isn’t it too cold for this outfit?

No, no… I mean, yes, but it means nothing.

So many people running around and you’re just strolling down the alley without any hurry… How?

Ah, but it’s so simple… Existing among others, we are subject to norms and customs, even if they’re harmful for us…

Meanwhile, I do not stand for this absurdity and simply live by my own rules.

Um… Are you trying to say the chaotic pursuit of all those people is absurd?
--Contemplative existentialist
--portrait Philosopher Philosopher
Oh, not just that. Take life itself, for example. It doesn’t have an objective goal to it.
--portrait Philosopher_Focused Philosopher
We are being pushed into this world without any guiding signs or methods to exist that are proven to work.
--portrait Philosopher Philosopher
Isn’t that simply foolish?

I… Suppose so?
--Contemplative existentialist

Thankfully, one can deal with that.

I wonder what hour is it… Damn it, something’s wrong with my watch again!
--portrait Philosopher_Focused Philosopher
Wait, aren’t you two those famous watchmakers?
--Anna

Indeed, that’s us. I suppose you know where our workshop is?
--Contemplative existentialist
--portrait Philosopher_Smiling Philosopher
Yes, I do. What a hilarious absurdity, to meet you right at this moment! Well, then, I’ll be very grateful for your help. Of course, I’ll come over myself to pick up my watch.
