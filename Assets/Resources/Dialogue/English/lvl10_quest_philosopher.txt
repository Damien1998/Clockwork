Contrary to expectations, the Christmas fever does not affect everyone. A perfect example of that is a young man, slowly strolling in his own pace, paying no mind to the crowds. He is most certainly not dressed warm enough for the weather. He seems lost… But in his own way, free.

Isn’t it too cold for this outfit?

No, no… I mean, yes, but it means nothing.

So many people running around and you’re just strolling down the alley without any hurry… How?

Ah, but it’s so simple… Existing among others, we are subject to norms and customs, even if they’re harmful for us…
--portrait Philosopher_Smiling Contemplative existentialist
Meanwhile, I do not stand for this absurdity and simply live by my own rules.

Um… Are you trying to say the chaotic pursuit of all those people is absurd?
--Contemplative existentialist
--portrait Philosopher Contemplative existentialist
Oh, not just that. Take life itself, for example. It doesn’t have an objective goal to it.
--portrait Philosopher_Focused Contemplative existentialist
We are being pushed into this world without any guiding signs or methods to exist that are proven to work.
--portrait Philosopher Contemplative existentialist
Isn’t that simply foolish?
--Anna
--portrait Anna_Snow_Abashed Anna
I… Suppose so?
--Contemplative existentialist
--portrait Philosopher_Smiling Contemplative existentialist
Thankfully, one can deal with that.

I wonder what hour is it… Damn it, something’s wrong with my watch again!
--portrait Philosopher_Focused Contemplative existentialist
Wait, aren’t you two those famous watchmakers?
--Anna
--portrait Anna_Snow Anna
Indeed, that’s us. I suppose you know where our workshop is?
--Contemplative existentialist
--portrait Philosopher_Smiling Contemplative existentialist
Yes, I do. What a hilarious absurdity, to meet you right at this moment! Well, then, I’ll be very grateful for your help. Of course, I’ll come over myself to pick up my watch.
