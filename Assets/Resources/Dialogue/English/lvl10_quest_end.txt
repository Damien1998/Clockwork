Thank you, I’ll just get my change and we can settle the payment.

I’m sorry, I have a question… Regarding the existential absurd… You mentioned a way to deal with this problem.
--portrait Philosopher Philosopher
It’s all about freedom. Only a free individual has the right to call themselves authentic.
Life is what we make it. It is our life and nobody can live it for us.
One has to take care of it, according to one’s conscience, of course.
--portrait Anna_Concerned Anna
But won’t this unlimited freedom lead to - if I may call it that - unwanted situations?
--portrait Philosopher_Focused Philosopher
Freedom must go hand-in-hand with responsibility. 
Otherwise it will become the negation of itself. We need to set our own boundaries that we will not cross.
--portrait Philosopher Philosopher
But if you truly want to break free… Well, I mentioned this before, but you need to rebel against the world.

Within reason, of course.

Oh, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Here’s your money. And, as a bonus, have this. As a memento from our meeting.
--portrait Anna_Surprised Anna
Thank you… What an interesting thing.

See you. Merry Christmas, and spread the truth. If you want to, of course.
