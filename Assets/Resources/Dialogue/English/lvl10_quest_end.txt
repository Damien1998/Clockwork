I’m sorry, I have a question… Regarding the existential absurd… You mentioned a way to deal with this problem.

It’s all about freedom. Only a free individual has the right to call themselves authentic.
Life is what we make it. It is our life and nobody can live it for us.
One has to take care of it, according to one’s conscience, of course.

But won’t this unlimited freedom lead to - if I may call it that - unwanted situations?

Freedom must go hand-in-hand with responsibility.

Otherwise it will become the negation of itself. We need to set our own boundaries that we will not cross.

But if you truly want to break free… Well, I mentioned this before, but you need to rebel against the world.

Within reason, of course.
